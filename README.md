## Purpose
This README accompanies the `wifi_practice_tasks_aircrack_ng.md` practice guide. It outlines a progressive set of hands-on lab tasks to learn wireless security testing with the Aircrack-ng suite and related tools.

## Files
- `wifi_practice_tasks_aircrack_ng.md` — Full practice tasks (10 tasks, from adapter checks to capstone).
- `wifi_practice_tasks_aircrack_ng.pdf` — PDF export of the tasks (if included).
- `README_PracticeTasks.md` — This file (overview & usage instructions).

## How to run the labs (suggested)
1. Read the **Lab setup** section and ensure your hardware & software meet requirements.
2. Start with **Task 1** and complete tasks in order; they build foundational skills.
3. Use a disposable or isolated AP (physical router you own or virtual AP with `hostapd`) for all intrusive tests.
4. Keep logs of commands and timestamps for reporting and learning.

## Deliverables for Capstone (Task 10)
- Raw capture files (pcap/pcapng)
- Command history or scripts used during the test
- A short 1-page report with findings and mitigation recommendations

## Safety & Ethics
- Only test networks you own or have explicit written permission to test.
- Never capture or analyze traffic containing PII unless explicitly authorized.
- Use intrusive attacks (deauth, MDK, WPS PIN brute force) only in isolated lab environments.

## Want more?
I can generate:
- Ready-to-run bash scripts for Tasks 1–4.
- A printable scoring checklist for Task 10.
- A sample `hostapd.conf` and a script to create a virtual AP for practice.
Choose one and I'll produce it.
